I'd love to hear your thoughts and suggestions on this.

Following are the features which I add in the project with the particular concept i used:
1) I used the Realtime Swiggy Api for high-performant application and to avoid CORS Error.
2) Lazy Loading for App Optimization (When you click on the particular product(food) for more
 description then by this it cannot load the whole content insantly).
3) Simmer UI Integration for better UI exprience (Library => react-shimmer-effects).
4) Image Sliders (From Codespan).
5) Add Filter Buttons for filtering the Data based on categories(UseState Hook).
6) Dark Mode & Light Mode (UseContext Hook).
7) For API calling (UseEffect Hook).
8) Icons (React Icons).
9) Use Tailwind CSS (Overall).
10) Add Search Functionalty (UseState Hook)
11) Add Error page for wrong url(UseRouteError).
12) Add cards description & reading url(useParams).
13) Cart Page=>Add products and Remove Products.(Redux ToolKit).
15) Parcel for Building App.
16) Vercel for Deployment.
17) React Router Dom for routing.
18) Implemented Infinite Scrolling.
19) Fully Responsive using Tailwind Css.
20) Tech Stack: *React-Js *Redux *Redux-Toolkit* Tailwind CSS* React-Router-Dom.
